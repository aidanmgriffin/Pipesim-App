Age Plot
********

The age plot plots the age (y-axis) vs. expel time (x-axis) for each particle expelled from the pipe network. Individual flows are differentiated by color.

Concentration Plot
******************

If free chlorine decay is selected, a chlorine concentration plot will be produced charting the free chlorine concentration (y-axis) vs. time expelled (x-axis) for each particle in the pipe network. Individual flows are differentiated by color.

Flow Plot
*********

The flow plot represents flow in the pipnetwork by simulation time and flow rate. Individual flows are differentiated by color.

Pipe Network Diagram
********************

The pipe network diagram is a visual representation of the logical tree that forms from the inputted pipe network.
